# Decision-Tree-Classification

# Overview:

This repository contains a Machine Learning model for classification using the Decision Tree algorithm. Decision trees are powerful tools for both classification and regression tasks. This model is built from scratch, including the implementation of node splitting, entropy calculation, and information gain for the splitting criterion.

# Libraries Used:

1. pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
2. numpy: For numerical computing.
3. matplotlib: For plotting graphs and charts.
4. seaborn: For data visualization.
5. sklearn.tree: For decision tree classifier implementation.
6. sklearn.metrics: For evaluating model performance metrics such as accuracy.
7. plot_tree: For visualizing the decision tree.

# Data Preprocessing:

1. One-Hot Encoding: Categorical variables are converted into numerical values using one-hot encoding to make them compatible with the 2. 2. decision tree algorithm.
3. Feature Importance: Feature importance is determined using a heatmap to visualize the significance of each feature in the dataset.

# Model Implementation:

The decision tree model is implemented from scratch, including the following steps:

1. Node Splitting: The dataset is recursively split into subsets based on the values of features to maximize information gain.
2. Entropy Calculation: Entropy is calculated to measure the impurity of each split.
3. Information Gain: Information gain is used as the splitting criterion to determine the best attribute to split the data at each node.
4. Tree Plotting: The decision tree is plotted recursively using a recursive function.

# Model Evaluation:

The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy metrics. Accuracy is calculated using the sklearn.metrics module. Additionally, the decision tree structure is visualized using the plot_tree function from the sklearn.tree module.

# Usage:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file.
3. Prepare your dataset and ensure it is in the appropriate format for classification.
4. Modify the code as needed to fit your dataset and problem.
5. Run the decision_tree_classification.py script to train the decision tree model and evaluate its performance.
6. Adjust hyperparameters and preprocessing steps as necessary to improve model performance.
